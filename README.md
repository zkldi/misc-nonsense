Various stuff I dump in a new directory whenever I start a new project.

This contains all of my preferences and configurations for things. This is stored on github mainly for archival purposes - incase I lose my HDD or something.

## Typescript Projects

Pretty much just a bootstrapper for Typescript projects.

## Linux

### Xmodmap

I use an incredibly sketchy keyboard layout (US hardware, UK software), and linux doesn't natively support alt gr + # as \ and shift + altgr + # as |.
Those keys are important for programming.

### kb-startup.sh

There's an open bug in X for over a decade now where CapsLock deactivates significantly after the key is pressed. This is bad for idiot typers like me
who hit CapsLock twice to Capitalise Words Like This (I'm serious, by the way)
